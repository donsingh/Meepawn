# Meepawn
AutoHotKey Script for Playing With Meepo in Dota 2

##Instructions


`Window+P` to Toggle Script ON/OFF

**Make sure you have the following settings:**

*Dagger on `Alt+Q` as Item Slot 1 (Row 1, Col 1)

*Boots of Travel on `Alt+A` as Item Slot 2 (Row 2, Col 1)

*Group ALL Clones in Control Group in number `1`

###Basic Commands

By default, script assumes you have 1 clone. To change it so it would tab-poof to the correct number of meepos:


`Alt+NUM1` = Set to 1 Clone

`Alt+NUM2` = Set to 2 Clones

`Alt+NUM3` = Set to 3 Clones

`Alt+NUM4` = Set to 4 Clones


`c` = Jump Main Meepo to Cursor Position and Poof All Clones

`v` = Jump Main Meepo to Cursor Position and Poof All Clones + Main Earthbind

`b` = All Meepos Poof in current position

#Work-In-Progress
Binding `,` to scatter Meepos. Clicks doesnt seem to work when moving mouse for non activated cursors...
